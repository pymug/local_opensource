race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate 
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption 
of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

- 2) No reference to other usergroups covertly or explicitly either with good or evil intentions
on social media, blog posts, in-person or anywhere concerning the event

- 3) No usergroup recruiting. The event aims at promoting OpenSource and not a usergroup in
particular. Information asked can be directed to the respective usergroup's website or main
online presence.

Harassing below refers to the 3 numbered points above.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or 
expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. 
Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop venues
